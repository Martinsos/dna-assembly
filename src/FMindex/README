Use makefile to create executable like this:
    make testFromFile
    or
    make simpleDemo


## testFromFile ##
Create executable like this: make testFromFile
Executable testFromFile will be created and you can use it to test on a file how does FMindex work.
Arguments of testFromFile:
    1. path to file containing text.
    2. number of characters that will be taken from the beginning of file, rest is not used.
    3. length of random pattern that is going to be queried for.
    4. number of random patterns.
testFromFile will read given number of characters from given file,
build FMindex upon them, then it will extract given number of random patterns(substrings) from indexed part of file
where each pattern is of given length and it will query them using FMindex.

example of usage:
./testFromFile english.50MB 100000 30 1000


## simpleDemo ##
Create executable like this: make simpleDemo
Executable simpleDemo will be created and you can use it for quick demonstration of FMindex.
simpleDemo takes no arguments.

example of usage:
./simpleDemo
