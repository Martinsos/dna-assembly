libgist v.1.0 Installation Notes</H1>

<CENTER>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></CENTER>

<H2>
Portability</H2>
Libgist was developed under Digital Unix with the g++ compiler and was
ported to Windows NT with the Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 compiler and to
Solaris (both x86 and Sparc) and HP/UX with g++. Since these platforms
are quite different, we expect the code to be somewhat portable, but have
not done extensive porting ourselves. Before you port libgist to other
platforms, please check the <A HREF="http://s2k-ftp.cs.berkeley.edu:8000/gist/libgist/">libgist
home page</A> and see if anybody has done it for you already. If not, and
you succeed in porting, contact us at <A HREF="mailto:gist@postgres.berkeley.edu">gist@postgres.berkeley.edu</A>!

NT Installation Notes</H2>

<H3>
Requirements</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Either an unzip package, or tar and gunzip. All of these are widely available
on the web.</LI>

<LI>
Microsoft Visual C++ version 5.0; earlier versions may work, but we make
no guarantees</LI>

<LI>
Microsoft Developer Studio: not strictly necessary, but you will have to
create your own NMAKE files if you don't have Developer Studio and want
to build the demonstration executables.</LI>

<LI>
Bison &amp; flex: not actually required for libgist, but necessary to use
the demonstration code. Bison and flex for Windows are freely available
on the Web from a variety of sources.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Procedure</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
Run the <TT>make.bat</TT> script in the <TT>src</TT> directory; this will
create the libraries and the parsers for the demo executables.</LI>

<LI>
There are two demo projects (in src/examples/btree and src/examples/rtree);
in order to build the executables, load their workspaces into Developer
Studio.</LI>

<LI>
Libraries and executables will be left with their sources.&nbsp; If you
wish to install them elsewhere, you will need to do so by hand.</LI>
</OL>

UNIX Installation Notes</H2>

<H3>
Requirements</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Either an unzip package, or tar and gunzip. All of these should be somewhere
on your system; if not, they are widely available on the Web.</LI>

<LI>
G++ version 2.7.2: other versions may work, as may other C++ compilers,
but we have not tested any.</LI>

<LI>
Gmake: you may substitute make, but will need to rewrite the (simple) Makefiles
to suit.</LI>

<LI>
Bison &amp; flex: not actually required for libgist, but necessary in order
to compile the demonstration code. Bison and flex are freely available
on the Web from a variety of sources. It is possible that yacc and lex
may be substituted, but we have not tested them.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Procedure</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
Edit the top-level Makefile, and set paths for the various tools and the
g++ include directory.</LI>

<LI>
Run <TT>gmake</TT> from the <TT>src</TT> directory -- it will recursively
make libgist, the B-tree and R-tree extensions and all the examples.</LI>

<LI>
If you want to run some test scripts to make sure everything is working,
cd to ../tests and type ./runtests. If nothing suspicious comes up on the
screen, your installation has passed the tests.</LI>

<LI>
Libraries and executables will be left with their sources.&nbsp; If you
wish to install them elsewhere, you will need to do so by hand.</LI>

SHORE Patch Installation Notes <br>
(Warning: This patch has not been tested!)</H2>

<H3>
Requirements</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Either an unzip package, or tar and gunzip. All of these should be somewhere
on your system; if not, they are widely available on the Web.</LI>

<LI>
GNU patch.
</LI>

</UL>

<H3>
Procedure</H3>

<OL>
<LI>
Untar <tt>shorepatch.tar</tt> in the <tt>src</tt> directory of your SHORE
installation; this  will install the new source files in the directories
<tt>sm</tt> and <tt>sm/ssh</tt>.

<LI>
From the <tt>src</tt> directory, run <tt>patch &lt patchfile</tt>. 
</LI>
